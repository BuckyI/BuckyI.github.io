根据 <https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31605985/Shots> 等结合自己听词进行修改，有几处存疑..

- "at the roadside we used to know" 看到有人写成 "at the road sign …" 感觉也挺有道理的.
- "from the second that I .." 从我出生那刻起，意思是正常的，但是听起来很像 "from the second day I.."
    搜到的歌词一般都写成前者，而 <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zV411W7EM> 这个现场版本底部歌词写成 "from the second day"
- "I can't help you when I'm only …." 意思怪怪的，听起来应为 "I can't have you"

## 1 Original

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done

Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh I'm gonna mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It(I?) seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a
Way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do
You wrong

Oh I'm gonna mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
(we) Used to show
In the moonlight
(we) Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

In the meantime, let it go
At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
(we) Used to show
In the moonlight
(we) Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zV411W7EM> 这个版本的，刚开始节奏慢很喜欢，所以单独列个词

Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you
and I'm only gonna do you wrong
(**cause** I'm only gonna do you wrong) [Shots bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Kr4y167n4?p=2)

Oh I'm gonna mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second day I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
(Oh )I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

（此处变快）

Am I out of ~~luck~~ touch? （[Shots bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Kr4y167n4?p=2) 这里听起来是 luck)
Am I waiting to break?
(When) I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'm taking for granted
I can't have you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh I'm gonna mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second day I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side we used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

Cause you've always got to change your mind
Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second day I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
~~Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved~~
Oh let me make it up to you
Let me make it up to you
（应该是吧）

In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side we used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

Am I out of touch
Am I out of my place
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh I'm gonna mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the meantime we let it go
At the roadside (that) we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born I think I had a loaded gun
(And) then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck
Am I waiting to break
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh I'm gonna mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the meantime we let it go
At the roadside (that) we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything
Oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
I think I had a loaded gun
(And) then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
