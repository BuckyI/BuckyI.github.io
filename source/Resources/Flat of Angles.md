I'll miss you
I'll miss our walks
Trying to pretend we are in perfect step
Out of step now
Sick on the floor
Out of the room
Fenced in, trapped
I can still hear the schoolchildren play outside at their usual 10: 30
It always used to annoy me, as I was trying to sleep, but it doesn't now
It seems alright
A replacement, a continuation
Their sound jangles around the room
It sounds so different from where I've been
A party, alone
Packed in with others, but never feeling so alone
People dance too close
She was there, I had only gone because I hoped she would be
I had arrived early, as the the streetlights were coming on
So I took a long walk around the block
Taking a few extra lefts and rights
Past the Chicken Cottage and the Costcutter
Then along a crescent that arced me out of my way
Past a group of figures huddled
Under the entrance to the flats
Shielding the flicking lighter from the wind
This… area is little more
Than a traffic island
A triangle around which cars and coaches stream into town up the bleak Old Kent
Or out into Kent and the coast
The same faces trudge around there for yeas
"Spare some change please? Much as possible."
"You want to buy some weed."
"Do you have a spare cigarette?"
He always wants one
And that one about weed was not a question
There is a Samaritans office between two severely dilapidated buildings on a black-bricked terrace
It has a thermometer painted on a 10 ft wooden board nailed to the outside
There is red paint up to the £0 mark, and, an ambitious 10 ft higher
Is written £200, 000
It never got any warmer there
The Man begging in the corner makes me take a huge detour when going towards my flat
He looks up with a pitiful stare that makes me want to kick the misery out of him
His dipit wee cup of unwanted coffee
A child's sleeping bag
JJB sports
A crack, a release, his poor exhaust
He was lost
The Broadway
The Town Hall, such a grand building, all nautical reminiscences, here, far from water
It would be quite a sight if you could get far back enough from it to take a look
But my back is up against the black panelling of the gay sauna opposite
A coach thunders by, and I run past the video shop that I owe £5 to
Meaning go way back
I may be becoming one of those people you see in New Cross
I have a book, peeping out of one pocket, at least want to look vaguely intellectual if someone I know
Or worse, someone who knows me walks by
I throw down the finish can into the pile between two walls, outside my flat
Look, there's the hardware store
It has a large cutout of a radiant man and woman in overalls
The woman handing the man a tin of paint, up his ladder, beaming
It has faded in the sun
I bought creosote from there, once
What a night!
Pure ment.!
It was messy!
It was out of hand! It was out of space!
I rapped on that track once, at Bagley's, remember it?!
Skibbadee handed me the mic
I got to shout "I'M GONNA SEND HIM TO OUTER SPACE TO FIIIND ANOTHER RACE!"
Absolutely fantastic, those days…
The pills these days are not the same, they don't work
No love
I was chatting to this bloke in the kitchen, and he said something, I can’t remember what, but I had to push him over, crashed his arse on the coffee table, ash tinnies and CDs everywhere! Spilled the lines too, the fat bastard

I can’t get you out of my head, your loving is all I think about, no I can’t get you out of my head, something something is all I think about. I can’t get this loop out of my head, no I think I’ll（gotta） have to… I need to sit down. I can’t stop my leg jiggling, it wants to be somewhere else. I need to get out of here. I can hear sirens – can you hear them? Then again, they are always here, the background to day to day life here. When music is playing, and they come, they sometimes sync up. The New Cross Remix, I call it. I used to call it.

This isn’t how it advertised itself. It was fun, it was Technicolour, the music made me feel liquid, I melted into the company and was chief among them. I was in the kitchen, pouring pint after pint of water over myself, insisting to a stranger that “No, no… The drinks are on me!” I can’t remember what happened after that. Except her there. I had managed to talk to her, I was talking about an art gallery, I thought she’d be impressed, but her eyes kept dancing around the space behind me, smiles flickered on her lips as her eyes focused on scenes I was oblivious to. I heard laughter. It was from my throat, but I didn’t feel it. I was just trying to breathe life into a long-dead persona.

Is there any more drink around here? Do you have any? Its alright, I haven’t been to bed yet – I’m not drinking in the morning! I swear I had a couple of… no I think I had them before I headed out last night.
I sometimes feel like I am in the 1980s
其实有时候觉得自己像活在20世纪80年代一样
Or perhaps it's part of my mom's fault watching Esatenders
好吧也许是受我妈正在看Esatenders的影响
With my family lying back on the green velour sofa
我的家人正卧在浅绿色的天鹅绒沙发上
Looking out at the sodium lights of the A505
研究着A505光钠灯
Hands fiddling with the glass on the tarnished aluminium of
手上摆弄着生锈铝壳上的二次双层玻璃
The Secondary double glazing thinking imagining romantic futures
思考着 幻想着 浪漫的未来
Set out for me by songs

I was a little shocked, hadn’t expected it, and jumped a little.

She did the same thing a second later, smiling.

And she tilted her head right.

Nothing else existed for a second there, I felt calm, and wanted no more.

Pretending we are hip,

Throwing our bodies around the room,around the town,

Projected on cheap MDMA and ciders with ice, our shadows are long.
计划着廉价的摇头丸 加冰的苹果酒 我们的影子是长的
They slip over the horizon, grow thinner,

That is greater than any of us.
这比我们任何人都要重要
Then morning comes, and it goes away.
接着清晨苏醒 早上过去
It peels the film from eyes,

Sparks cells into action,
鼓动着每一个细胞
And eventually resurrects those who have avoided it.

Just the strange flock texture on the wallpaper behind her in the corridor,
只剩下走廊里在她身后留下的棉束纹理
The magnolia paintwork,
木兰涂漆
The sick yellow light from a bare bulb,
还有没有灯罩的灯泡散发出来的暗黄色
And decades of greasy black hand marks by the top of the stairs.
以及几十年前印在楼梯顶端的油腻黑手印···
Her eyes were…
她的眼睛
Black.
是漆黑的。

I just can't access my thoughts
Or put them into words
I think now my brain recycle been awaiting deletion
Still no reply to my text, I send to its …
Oh, let me see
9:48, and it's now 10 o'clock
She hasn't texted to me in response
To my imploring, longing, yearning message
full of wiring sudden grief
Thus, morning!（exclamation mark）
How are you
I enjoyed our journey in the dark so can't wait this night!（exclamation mark）
Back at my place, looking forward to the gig tonight
what time can you get there?
Where is Rhythm Factory?
Have a great day! （exclamation mark）
Kiss.
As many questions as possible all crying out for response
surface lightness, reflective even
Asking after, referring to events our showing her I'm thinking of her
The kiss bow
That was contemplative for a good five minutes although we held hands briefly
Near McDonald's on the Earl's Court Road last night
I don't know that was to forward the kiss, too presumptuous now
But, her touch, sent a clean electric impulse through me
up my arm, into my brain
It cuts through the K, the sodium light
the rain I longed to protect her from my arms
Now he's check of the message this phone results
and a little clutch of pain somewhere of the sanity is heart
There are snails climbing all over the walls of my bathroom. There is a bush outside the window, and when it rains, if I have left the window open, which I need to sometimes, they crawl in. The iridescent tracery they leave on unknown journeys sparkles in the bulb-light. I take a Tesco-bag glove and gather them, bundle them out the window.

My time span with you before the war.

She said she was going to Spain, hoped it wouldn’t rain, heard it wouldn’t rain. I wanted to go too, she said she was a solo traveller, it was her rule, she goes on journeys alone. With plenty to read. I recommend some books, so that perhaps a thought of me would go with her. Perhaps I am the only thought she had. Or more probably, she never thought of me, as I did of her. I wanted to say these things, but there was always a wall around me, I could never tell people how much they meant to me. I could tell others how much I hated some people, but could never even tell a friend I appreciated their company until I’d had 10 cans, then it would descend into a stereotypical drunken “You’re my best mate, you are.”

So we opened that bottle of absinthe, and sat on the couch. I knocked a copy of The Face onto the floor, and cleared away a few cans with my boots. We turned to face each other there, and my knee touched hers. I looked at our knees together, hers at the top of the black leather boots, hidden in grey woollen tights, with little bobbles on them. Her knee moved imperceptibly away, but I felt it. I looked up to her face as she said “Drink a shot with me, and look me in the eye as you do.” We did. I didn’t feel the effect of the alcohol, but her eyes gave me a warm glow, I was swallowed by them, as she swallowed the green liquid. I couldn’t get enough. We did it again and again. Rinse, then repeat. As needed.

Well, we were fabric for a drama bass night
we were about to bow about four
Just getting our coats, when we and Tim getting some sorts of trouble with the coat room attendant, he lost his ticket
She said "we'd have to wait until the end to get the coat
So we had to sit outside by the meat market, in the freezing cold
At least wear our coats
Until 8, when it was finally over
Tim with his only coat hanging around in the middle of this desert
And then Tim, put his hand, in his jeans' pocket and pulls out a sweat rubbish ruffled ticket
saying "I had it all along"
Doug, saw this, he just screws his hands up into his face
forces them to his side
shaking, grating his teeth, growling
moving off slowly, muttering "fu~~~XX"
Oh no, my number will be on her phone.
They’ll know.
I need to get round there and delete the calls.
So it

“Out of the strong, came forth sweetness.” It says that on the tins of Lyle’s Golden Syrup. Have you ever noticed that? It has a picture of a lion, dead, surrounded by bees, buzzing around, and feasting on the lion’s innards. It is from a Biblical story, someone was going somewhere, saw the lion dead in the sunshine, and carried on. On his way back, the bees had started to form a hive within the lion, and were creating honey. Hence out of the strong…

I have enough here to join her, to join the lion. I can’t walk around the block once more, again. I’ve been doing that for years, and I have never escaped. I don’t even know why I’m doing it. I’m going nowhere, like those snails, except out the window. The streets are full of mercenary eyes. Veins full of evil serum. 90 degrees from window. Right down to its gables.
