```
featured_image: /path/to/your/image.jpg 
```

## Profile Page

The profile page, or the home page, is the very first page of your site. By default, there is a title, some body text, several links and a profile image on this page. You can customize the content of your profile at the `config.yml` file of the theme:

```
# profile
profile:
  title: Your profile title.
  body: Your profile body
  image: /path/to/your/image.jpg 

  links:
  	Blogs: /archive/
  	Resume: /path/to/your/resume.pdf
  	Projects: /categories/gallery/
```

In case you prefer to customize your profile page, go to `frame/layout/pages/profile.ejs` and modify the layout and style of your own page, have fun ðŸ™Œ

## Tag Page

Frame provides a tag cloud on the `/tag/` page, which contains all possible tags in your blog. In order to set up the tag cloud, you need to create a hexo page named `tag`. 

```

```
---
title: '''tag'''
layout: tag
---
```
